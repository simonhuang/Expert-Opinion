# Expert Opinion

## Project
This is our project for the 2014 Waterloo Facebook Hackathon. The idea was to create a reddit-style forum where users would post yes/no questions related to certain fields of study and other users would answer those questions. We would ask users to sign in with facebook in order to determine how much of an 'Expert' they are in certain fields. The more of an expert someone is, the more influence their vote counts for.
